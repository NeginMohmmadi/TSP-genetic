# TSP-genetic

A Solution for Travelling Salesman Problem Based on Genetic Algorithm in Python.
This project includes several Cross-Over and Mutation algorithms:
+ Cross-Over
```
Order (OX1)
Order Based (OX2)
Position Based (POS)
Partially Mapped (PMX)
Cycle (CX)
Edge Recombination (ER)
Alternating Position (AP)
```
+ Mutation
```
Displacement (DM)
Insertion (ISM)
Inversion (IVM)
Exchange (EM)
Simple Inversion (SIM)
Scramble (SM)
```
The combination of algorithms was evaluated by Time Complexity and Cost of Path.
